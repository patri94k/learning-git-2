                <p>Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
                Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
                Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
                Dance me to the end of love
                Dance me to the end of love
                <br>
                <br>
                Oh, let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
                Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
                Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
                Dance me to the end of love
                Dance me to the end of love
                <br>
                <br>
                Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
                Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
                We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
                Dance me to the end of love
                Dance me to the end of love
                <br>
                <br>
                Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
                Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
                Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
                Dance me to the end of love
                Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
                <br>
                <br>
                Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
                Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
                Dance me to the end of love
                Dance me to the end of love
                Dance me to the end of love</p>
